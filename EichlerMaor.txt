Jews are just less forgiving because it wasn’t other Jews killing us. And we have more

@Jon_Star @SethAMandel A common rule today seems to be that just because you

@davidhazony What killed socialism in Israel was the stagnation of the 70s,
bankruptcies of kibbutzim, and the fact that Israeli socialism was heavily into stopping
you from having too much stuff instead of promising you more stuff. The
hyperinflation of the 80s was due to non-socialists.

@Pball01 @toteskosh Lots of people move from one home they don’t own to another.

to accept that if you never bought the house and you didn’t build it, maybe you don’t
own it. It’s really not hard.

@AlexKontorovich The FDA was founded to check that drugs are not snake oil to be
banned (a rational government function) but later got the job of checking whether

@EVKontorovich The vaccination should not be noticeably affecting total number of
cases, because even 20% immunity isn’t much. It should affect deaths, because these
are overwhelmingly among ages 70+, but it takes time, and many of the deaths now
are in people who were infected a while ago.

@tarek74 @Thani75 I am not dogmatically opposed to that idea - merely convinced it
is hopeless. The Palestinians can’t even get Fatah and Hamas to work together in a

single government. I also doubt that a merger with the undemocratic Fatah and Hamas
regimes can result in more democracy.

@tarek74 @Thani75 Why not? The Arab populations in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza

More to the point, politicians working in the interest of their voters is the basis of
democracy, not an exclusionary ideology.

@tarek74 @Thani75 As a (more or less) supporter of the government, I can confirm

@greenrya004 @asymmetricinfo @mattyglesias @DeanBaker13 The patent system
also has a requirement to reveal secrets. But it doesn’t really work because the
inventors don’t want to, it’s hard to define what needs to be revealed, and it’s hard to
discover failures to comply. A contract system doesn’t change that.

@IsraelexLive They don’t need results to be the same. For example, if only 10%
change their vote, they just need to correctly poll those 10% (who will have a much
smaller margin of error). Everyone already knows how the other 90% voted.

@IsraelexLive You need a bit more than 10,000 people for that kind of margin.
Methodological problems should be easy to check - if the exit polls are wrong, it would
suggest there was collusion (which wouldn’t mean the polls are unscientific, only that
there aren’t really 3 different ones).

@IsraelexLive Exit polls generally have much larger samples than regular polls, so the
margin of error should be considerably lower than the usual 4-5%.

@biannagolodryga So when the US identifies people as being of the "Hispanic" or
"Pacific Islander" race, that's just in preparation for massive discrimination?

@Dan_March_ @Dawnsfire @SethAMandel 1. So it's not just white nationalists who
think American Jews can have another nationality. It's also US law. 2. The dictionary
says shared religion can be an ethnic group 3. I'd like to see your evidence

@Dan_March_ @Dawnsfire @SethAMandel 1. This is inconsistent with dual citizenship
being perfectly legal 2. "American national" is a legal term which does not contradict
the fact that Americans are of various ethnicities. 3. Who is the Civil Rights Act
protecting by barring discrimination by nationality? Foreigners?

@Dan_March_ @Dawnsfire @SethAMandel Yes I am, because that makes just as much

your ethnicity ("a social group that shares a common and distinctive culture, religion,
language, or the like")

@J3ffMiller @hawkinscm12 @jimgeraghty I don't disagree with your statement, but
heat generation by conversion of potential energy to thermal energy is neither of
those things.

@hawkinscm12 @J3ffMiller @jimgeraghty Heat generation (by fossil fuel or electric
heater) is fundamentally different than heat transfer (air conditioning). I think heat
generation has considerably more emissions.

@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz Prestige is extremely important. It's the only
reason Abbas and his Fatah troops or Haniyeh and his Hamas troops are ever treated
differently than the mafia. The Arab faction in the Knesset doesn't get its own militia,
and no functional binational state would do otherwise.

14/06/2019 14:37:16
@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz I don't understand. You want the PA to abandon
its laws, let its armed forces merge with Israeli armed forces, and have its officials lose
their prestige and start one or more parties to run for the Knesset? Sinn Fein only
accepted this because they didn't have much else.
https://twitter.com/EichlerMaor/status/1139497027241463809

14/06/2019 14:25:25
@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz The PA is a government with it's own laws,
budget, and armed forces - of course it would have to be eliminated. And Israel
doesn't have voting districts (seats are based on proportion of votes throughout the
whole country) so you can't convert the PA to Knesset voting districts.

14/06/2019 13:55:21
@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz It's binational only in the way that Israel is
already binational, i.e., there's a (voting) minority that gets along with the majority
much better than it used to. The state in NI's case (UK) has the same borders and basic
government structure as it did before.

14/06/2019 13:29:33
@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz NI's very existence represents a choice of
partitioning along ethnic lines over a binational Ireland. The peace process there
preserved the status quo by making very minor adjustments.

@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz A binational state isn't "viable" if it immediately

to allow democratic input, but I realize this is not a popular position.

@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz The difference being what? I assume you would
insist on the binational state being democratic, meaning the residents get to vote on
how the country is run regardless of what you call it. Also, they could (and would) vote
to split the state into two states.

@EvanCull @Imamofpeace @tedcruz The legal term for that is "annexation", and one
of the few things Israelis and Palestinians agree on is that that is a very bad idea. Heck,
most of the Palestinians in annexed east Jerusalem refuse to vote in Israeli elections
on principle.

which they have no democratic input for reasons having nothing to do with Israel also
has minor limitations on its power due to negotiated agreements with Israel, so it's

@jremes84 @sfrantzman It is undoubtedly ruled by religious zealots. I think the
zealots in Bnei Brak are calmer than those elsewhere, like in the Jerusalem area (my
theory is that this is due to having their own city), which would explain why I don't see
the vandalism there that Seth was discussing.
